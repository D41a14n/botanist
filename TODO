EASY
* deep linking to JIRA issue tags BUGS-1001 that appear in source, etc.
- use django caching (in memory?) to cache results for a few minutes
- add "last indexed" somehow so search reports when the code was last...indexed :)
- allow filtering out code search results that are import statements, usually they can be noisy when searching for something thats actually being used?

MEDIUM
* use is_fork = True thing in bitbucket's api. add a filter that would eliminate forks
- add filter to not return search results from comments in code
- prune deleted/renamed repositories (will have to be handled on the cron side)
- add repo multi-select to search page so you can scope search to a subset of all repos

HARD
- some lines of context (before/after)
- commit message searching (maybe less than hard? hmm)

MAYBE SOMEDAY
- add option to make the search non-regex based? (not sure if possible with google codesearch tool...)
- reindex based on bitbucket commit hook??? (not super worth it, reindexing is taking about 2 minutes on hundreds of repositories)

* are desireable ones
